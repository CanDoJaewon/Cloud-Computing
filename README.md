# Cloud-Computing

This is a summary place for me to learn about "Cloud-Computing" from IBM Full-Stack Certificate.
This course organizes with four different parts:
1. Overview
2. Cloud Computing Models
3. Components of Cloud Computing
4. Emergent trends & practices

I want to make the page for remind the concepts of cloud computing and memorize with my own words.
Thank you!
